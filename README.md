# Work-Day-Scheduler
My repo for the module 5 challenge to construct a work day scheduler

## Description
The following webpage is designed to meet the requirements of the Module 5 Challenge. It represents the beginnings of a day scheduling app for aspiring coders. Users update their day schedules by entering descriptions of daily events text into cells corresponding to the 24-hours of military time. The text is saved into local storage via a save button and can be retreived upon revisiting the web application. As time progresses during the day the text cells containing the user's daily events change from green (event is in the future) to red (event is happening now) to gray (event is in the past). The screen shots below show a hypothetical daily schedule.
